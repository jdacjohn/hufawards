<p>            In 1990 Byrd and his family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where he
worked for the U.S. Marshal Service.</p>
<p>            It was in 1995, while working as a campus supervisor at a local high
school that he received a call from Judge Judy, asking whether he would be interested
reuniting with her to do a TV court show. The rest, as they say, is history.

<p>           "Officer Byrd," while continuing in the role that has brought him worldwide
recognition, continues to broaden his horizons through work in theatre, commercials and
film. A published and recorded songwriter, the former Brooklynite is currently working on
animation and spoken word projects for children and adults. A staunch community
activist, Byrd is the chairman of the national board for the O.K. Program, an
organization designed to address social issues confronting young African-American
males.</p>
<p>            When not working on the <i>Judge Judy Show</i>, Byrd is a much sought after emcee
and inspirational speaker. He's emceed shows for Gerald Albright, Smokey Robinson,
Howard Hewitt, Brian Culbertson, War, Norman Brown, CeCe Winans and Take 6.</p>

<p>Byrd currently lives in the Sacramento area with his wife and four children. As to his
future plans, Byrd says, "The Bible tells me that God knows the plans He has for me. So
I'm content to just be His co-pilot!"</p>
