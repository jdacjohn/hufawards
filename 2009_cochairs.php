	<span>Mike Phillips - Jazz Saxophonist</span>
		
		<p>Hidden Beach NAACP Image Award nominated saxophonist Mike Phillips has changed the game and fans are responding. Armed with his signature passion and magnetic presence, this talented musician challenges established jazz norms by embracing a variety of musical influences while adding his own unique flavor to the mix.</p>
		
	<p>	After choosing Mike for a coveted spot in his world renowned NPG Band during his 90-city Musicology Tour, Rolling Stone quoted Prince praising Mike’s solo performances saying, "Wow, listen to those people responding, and all he’s doing is playing a saxophone. They can feel that what he’s doing is real. So many shows now…their so dead. But here’s one man breathing into an instrument, and the whole room feels alive. It made me want to rise up to that level when I came back onstage."</p>
