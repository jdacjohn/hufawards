<p> <strong>Kelly Price Bio Con't</strong></p>
Kelly's first in studio recording was at the age of 12 where she sang lead vocals on an independently recorded project with a local church choir. The process came easy to Kelly. Kelly's young age coupled with her mature vocal sound earned her a widely known reputation regionally causing her to be sought out by many producers of independent gospel projects throughout her teen years. By the time Kelly was 17 she was recording demos at no charge to up and coming music producers who were in need of a vocalist to record their music to shop it to the labels. 

<p>Her free labor would pay off by making a connection in January 1992 that would land Kelly her first major engagement performing live behind George Michael at Madison Square Garden in NYC. 
</p>
<p>This amazing jump-start was followed 1 month later by Kelly participating with a 40 voiced choir backing Mariah Carey at the Grammy Awards resulting in Kelly being asked personally by Mariah if she would be interested in working with her. Kelly's very first engagement with Mariah after this would be the now infamous MTV "Unplugged" where Mariah featured her in a vocal "step out" during the live performance of her  #1 smash "Someday". In the years to follow Kelly Price would become the most consistent voice on Mariah's records and the most consistent face seen on stage with Mariah for the next 5 1/2 years. 
</p>
<p> In 1995 at 22 years old Kelly began to actively pursue a serious career in songwriting, placing thoughts of being her own artist on the back burner after repeatedly being told that she could never make it as a mainstream R&B or pop artist performing her own music because she was too fat and her voice was too strong. She simply would not fit in with the lighter, more radio friendly sounding voices and lighter more television friendly figures that record executives preferred and the public wanted to buy.
</p>
<p>Initially willing to accept that seemingly firm rule of the music industry Kelly convinced herself that she didn't want to be an artist and went to work writing her songs and placing them with other artist to satisfy her need to get her music out. 
</p>
<p>The delay of Kelly's solo career proved to be anything but a delay. By taking the path of a writer first, Kelly walked into a world of amazing learning experiences and in no time became one of the most sought after song-writers in the music industry. Opportunities to record, share stages with and pen songs for a plethora of artists spanning multiple genres of music began to pour in. 
</p>
<p>In 1997 after touring with The Isley Brothers for several months and being wooed by lead singer Ronald Isley, Kelly signed with Isley's T â€“Neck Records (distributed by Island Records) giving her the long awaited platform and opportunity to test the waters for herself and release her own music in her own voice. Many who heard her compared her sound to the vocal styling of a young Aretha Franklin. 
</p>
<p>1998 Kelly's released her now double platinum plus debut CD "Soul of A Woman" which propelled her to the forefront of the music industry. This process was started with a clever marketing scheme to release the 1st single "Friend of Mine" without a video, limit her personal appearances and not have Kelly do any televised performances so the public would be forced to "hear her" first and love the music solely based on what they heard. . .the voice and the song. With a hit song and audiences growing bigger daily, what many thought was sure career suicide for a new artist resulted in a nationwide frenzy to find out who was Kelly Price? The result of this campaign was a victory for Kelly Price and would be for every truly talented plus sized female artist to follow her. Kelly made history by reaching the number 1 spot on the Billboard Charts and hold it for 5 weeks consecutively with no video, a feat never before accomplished by any artist since MTV and video play became instrumental in the way songs obtained chart position.
</p>
<p>After completing the video for "Friend of Mine" and releasing it to television the world had its first real view of the 250 plus pound diva and the song climbed back to Billboard's number one spot after having fallen in the ranks to another song. This was also a history-making feat and became the true victory of Kelly's story after having been seen by the world AND accepted in spite of her very full frame. The nation had spoken. Size did not matter!
</p>
<p>Kelly's subsequent albums were 2000's platinum plus "Mirror Mirror", her RIAA gold certified Christmas LP "One Family" released in 2001 and 2003's "Priceless" also reaching gold.
</p>
<p>Through musical collaborations Kelly has seen Billboard's top spot multiple times with many artists. Through her amazing writing, arranging and production skills, Kelly has brought her unmatched sound, ability and unique talent to the already distinct sounds of the music industry's best.

</p>
<p>In 2005 Kelly Price paid homage to her humble church beginnings just as her mentor Aretha Franklin did by going home and recording a live gospel CD. Appropriately titled "This Is Who I Am", Kelly had the opportunity to show everyone where it all came from. In 2006 Kelly Price achieved great success with this recording by entering Billboard's Gospel Album charts in the # 1 spot and staying there for 9 weeks and in June 2008 received a coveted ASCAP writer's award acknowledging the lead single "Healing" written and produced by Price as one of the most played songs at radio in the year 2007!
