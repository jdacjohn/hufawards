<p style="width: 637px;">	The word is spreading.....wives, sons, daughters, girlfriends and [fathers] are recognizing that the Honoring Unsung 
	Fathers Awards Brunch & Concert is the "family affair" place to be to celebrate all fathers on Father's Day. 
	Nearly 1200 guests, plus volunteers and vendors were in attendance. 36 nominations were received on time from
	 as far as New York, Tennessee, Mississippi and Florida. Although there were half the number of nominations 
	due to a strict application requirement, the quality of the nominations were superb. Unbeknownst to the nominated 
	fathers, upon arrival they were treated to a red carpet walk, with snapshots and interviews, then ushered to the
	 private VIP reception Hosted by Olive Garden. In addition, there was another new addition this year, along with
	 honoring fathers in the 5 general categories, Judge Mablean had a surprise for two unsuspecting fathers -- 
	bestowing the inaugural Founder's Award. The honorees are as follows:</p>
	
	
<ul><li>DeMone Chestnut, 31, Solo Warrior - Detective; Clarksville, Tennessee</li>
<li>	   Gary Brooks, 44, Love Cares - Engineer; Carson, California</li>
	 <li>Walter Smith, 66, Fatherhood Forever - Engineer; Los Angeles, California</li>
