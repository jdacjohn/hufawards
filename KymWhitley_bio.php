<p> <strong>Kym Whitley Bio Con't</strong></p>
<p>After a scene stealing run as the hilarious, wisecracking secretary in the UPN comedy series “Sparks”, Whitley became a 
	staple on television guest-starring on such popular shows such as the breakout hit “Grey’s Anatomy”, 
	HBO’s “Curb Your Enthusiasm”, which got her Emmy nods, Lifetime’s “Missing”, Disney’s “That’s So Raven”, 
	ABC’s “My Wife And Kids”, UPN’s “Love Inc.” & “The Parkers” and most recently the underground smash 
	“The Boondocks” on the Cartoon Network.

Whitley has just been added to the cast of FOX"S "Til Death" starring Brad Garrett.  The FOX execs asked Kym to join the 3rd
season of the show, as JB Smooth's wife, which is sure to be a hilarious match. Be sure to tune in this fall season (2008).

With all this talent, it comes as no surprise that Whitley’s career continues to flourish with several upcoming television 
and movie projects.  This summer on the big screen, she co-stars with Martin Lawrence and Raven Simon, in the film, 
“College Road Trip”.  She will also be featured in the Block buster movie "Black Dynamite” and "I Love You Man", released in 2009.

In addition to her film and television appearances, Kym performs side-splitting stand-up routines throughout the country.
