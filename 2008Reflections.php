	<div class="letter">To The Mablean Ephriam Foundation,
	 <p>
	On behalf of this years Father Of The Year-Love Cares Category, The 
	Entire Brox Family, including his wife and three daughters, would like 
	to thank the foundation for bestowing this most prestigious honor on 
	Michael Brox.</p>

	  <p>
	The event was outstanding, the host, the food, and entertainment were 
	five star and we are honored to have attended. The honor that was given 
	to our brother Michael Brox was what we feel was long overdue, and if 
	not for the Mablean Ephriam foundation he may have never been 
	recognized for his dedication to his family.</p>

	  <p>
	The great work you are doing for college bound and underprivileged 
	youth is special enough, and yet, you go a step further and honor 
	fathers each year.</p>
	  <p>

	We want to thank you again, and look forward to attending the event 
	next year, and hopefully to nominate another great father in our family.</p>

	  <p>
	Thank you for honoring our brother and his family with this magnificent 
	award.</p>
	  <p>
	The Entire Brox family,</p></div>
