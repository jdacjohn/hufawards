	<h3>KEISHAN HILLIARD – 2010 NURSING SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENT</h3>
	
	<p>I have been so grateful for the scholarship I have received from your foundation and wanting to show my appreciation, however something always comes up around HUF Awards. Unfortunately, I am working the whole Father’s Day weekend (16-18) because of a delay in the last portion of my nursing program.  The scholarship has really stood in the gap when I needed it and it’s been two years. I'm now finishing my Associates Degree Nursing program at El Camino College Compton Center and graduating next week! I'm so thankful for you and your words of encouragement. I will never forget them. Please keep in touch, I am sure I will be free at some point to volunteer and give back to your wonderful cause. Please let me know if there is anything I may do and anytime.</p>

	<h3>REFLECTIONS FROM PRIOR SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENT - STANLEY PRINCE</h3>
	
	<p>My name is Stanley Prince. I am currently a fourth year criminology major at California University Fresno.  I am a 2009  MEF  Scholarship Recipient. The Mablean Ephriam Foundation has been a blessing to me and my family since they awarded me with a scholarship. Till this very moment, I am very appreciative for the time taken out and the money spent to help me reach my goal of graduating from college and becoming a federal agent.  Over these four years, I have overcome many struggles and tribulations. I know it will be all worth it at the end.  Throughout college, God has surrounded me with great people to keep me motivated to keep moving forward to accomplish my goal.  Ms. Mablean Ephriam has been a great blessing to me. I encourage everyone I come in contact with to not only attend school but graduate just as she motivated me to do the same. Again, I would like to say thank you for your blessing on my life.  I pray that God blesses you even more to do bigger and better things.
</p>
	<p>With love and appreciation </p>

Hello Judge,
 that was the most exhilerating experience that I have had in a loooooooooooooong time.  The atmosphere, the people, the place where I sat, the MCs (Lewis et al), plus the food was just first class.  I'm looking forward to next year and hope to get more "special people" to comeSmileSmile.   </p> 
<p>
Thank you again for carrying out the vision,<br /> 
Delores Rogers</p>

Judge Mablean, you really know how to put together a event, we all had 
a awesometime, from beginning to end, everything was well organized, we were well
entertained, from the comedian, to Mike Phillips, to Loretta Devine, to 
TremaineHawkins, to all of the Awards and Scholarship Presenters.
The food, talking about "Finger Licking Good" their were so much to choose from, I wasn't sure what I wanted, 
so Idecided to have a little bit of everything.  Judge Mablean, I Thank you and
Frank Ephriam for allowing me the opportunity to be a part of such an
inspirational & important event. I am truly honored.

I admire the both of you, for your HARD work & dedication helping 
support the young people in our community. My prayer is that our heavenly father 
continue giving you both the Strength, Wisdom, knowledge & passion, to continue 
for years to come.</p>




              <p>   Thanks Again,<br>

<p>Dear Judge Mablean,

Congratulations on a job well done. My family and I truly enjoyed the
HUF Awards Ceremony! You and your Team were exceptional. Please know
that you were styling! “You Go Girl.”  Everything was so well done.
 Your program is a signature event. I have never had Southern cooking
in a hotel.  The food was fabulous. Come on now, you can tell me, I
know that there had to be some of us in the kitchen (lol).  No need to
confirm it. I already know (lol).</p>
