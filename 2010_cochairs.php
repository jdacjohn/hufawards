		<span><strong>Kym Whitley</strong> - Mistress of Ceremonies</span>
		

<p> Born in Sudan, Khartoum, Kym E. Whitley is funny, talented, and driven.  These are just a few of the qualities that define quadruple-threat actress, producer, director and stand-up comedienne Kym E. Whitley.  Proving she isn't just another pretty face, Kym created and co-hosted her own evening talk show on BET entitled "Oh Drama!"  These same qualities have made her an in-demand player, starring alongside some of Hollywood's elite in such box office hits as "Fun with Dick and Jane", Along Came Polly", "The Perfect Man", "Deliver Us From Eva" and "Next Friday".</p>

		<span><strong>Jenifer Lewis</strong> - Mistress of Ceremonies</span>
		

<p>		Jenifer Lewis is best known for her role as 'Lana Hawkins', the no-nonsense receptionist who maintains order in the clinic, in Lifetime Television's hit drama series "Strong Medicine.". Her innate ability to captivate an audience stems from her versatile voice, her bawdy sense of humor and her powerful acting performances honed largely in Broadway hits like "Eubie", ""Comin' Uptown", Dreamgirls" "Rock and Roll, the First 5,00 Years", and Neil Simon's "Promises Promises."  It was her tour with Bette Midler as an infamous Harlotte however that got Hollywood's calling.

		Once there, Lewis immediately garnered two NAACP Image Award nominations as Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Tina Turner's mother, in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT and in the romantic comedy THE PREACHER'S WIFE.  Both earning her the endearing title of "The Black Mother of Hollywood."
